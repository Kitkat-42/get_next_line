Typhoon Maysak was moving faster toward South Korea on Wednesday, keeping the country on alert over what was forecast to be one of the most powerful typhoons in years.
The typhoon was moving at 19 kph at seas some 310 kilometers south of Seogwipo in Jeju as of 9 a.m., according to the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). Its maximum wind speed was 45 meters per second.
Maysak was forecast to pick up speed in the evening to move at 31 kph as it approaches the country and lands on the southern coastal area in South Gyeongsang Province in the early hours of Thursday. 

The agency said Tuesday that Maysak may be more powerful than Typhoon Bavi that hit the country last week and was expected to follow a similar route as Typhoon Maemi that caused the second-highest property damage ever recorded in the country in 2003. 
The weather agency forecast the tropical storm would most affect the country's southern and eastern coastal areas while pouring heavy rains and bringing strong winds in the inner land area as well. 
Heavy rain was expected in the areas, with rain of more than 400 mm soaking Jeju and parts of the country's eastern coastal regions, such as Gangwon and North and South Gyeongsang provinces.
